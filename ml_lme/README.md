# Usage
## Settings
Available mod's settings in `Settings - Implementation - Leap Motion Tracking`:
* **Enable tracking:** enables/disables hands tracking from Leap Motion data, disabled by default.
* **Tracking mode:** sets Leap Motion tracking mode, available values: `Screentop`, `Desktop` (by default), `HMD`.
* **Desktop offset X/Y/Z:** offset position for body attachment, (0, -45, 30) by default.
* **Attach to head:** attaches hands transformation to head instead of body, disabled by default.
* **Head offset X/Y/Z:** offset position for head attachment (`Attach to head` is **`true`**), (0, -30, 15) by default.
* **Offset angle X/Y/X:** rotation around specific axis, useful for neck mounts, 0 by default.
* **Track elbows:** elbows tracking, works best in `Screentop` and `HMD` tracking modes, `true` by default.
* **Fingers tracking only:** applies only fingers tracking, disabled by default.
* **Model visibility:** shows Leap Motion controller model, useful for tracking visualizing, disabled by default.
* **Interaction input:** enables in-game interactions (props, menu and etc.); `true` by default.
* **Recognize gestures:** sets avatar gestures (fist, gun, rock'n'roll and etc.) based on current fingers pose; `false` by default.
* **Interact gesture threadhold:** activation limit for interaction based on hand gesture; 80 by default.
* **Grip gesture threadhold:** activation limit for grip based on hand gesture; 40 by default.
* **Filter humanoid limits:** Limits fingers rotations to be valid for Unity's Mechanim; `true` by default
  * Note: Enabling this option ensures that visual representation of your fingers will be same for you and remote players, but it cancels out additional finger segments rotations that can be better visually in most cases.
